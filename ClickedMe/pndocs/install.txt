pnClickedMe:
============

1. init & activate it in the module administration
2. let the module that shows the userprofile know 
   that pnClickedMe is now installed and should be used:
   
   a) Use this module with the 0.8 pnRender based Profile module
   
   Please add the following line to the file
   "system/Profile/templates/Profile_user_view.htm"
   
   <!--[pnmodapifunc modname="ClickedMe" type="user" func="addClick" clicked_uid=$userinfo.uid]-->

   That's all. Have a lot of fun!

   b) pnRender based user profile modules:
   
   Just add the following line to the template that 
   shows the details of the clicked user:
   
   <!--[pnmodapifunc modname="ClickedMe" type="user" func="addClick" clicked_uid=$uid]-->
   
   $uid is just an example - I don't know which variable 
   manages the user's uid-variable.
   If the username is given as argument / variable called "uname" 
   for example you would have to add the following line instead 
   of the line above:
   
   <!--[pnmodapifunc modname="ClickedMe" type="user" func="addClick" clicked_uname=$uname]-->

3. Install the block at your site. If there are any clicks 
   (without own clicks on the own profile) for your profile the 
   block will be displayed. Otherwise the block will not be shown!


4. OPTIONAL: Show the average of clicks a user has per day

   Just include the follwing code in the place of your template 
   where you want to have this value shown:
   
   This profile page is shown <!--[pnmodapifunc modname="ClickedMe" type="user" func="getAvg" uid=$userinfo.uid]--> times per day (avg).
